Hi there, name's Rasmus!

I'm a Swedish AV control systems programmer.

Visit my website: [rasbat.se](https://rasbat.se/)

I dabble in things made by Crestron, AMX, Kramer, QSC, Biamp, Audinate, D-Tools System Integrator, BSS Audio, Bose, Yamaha, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Epson, Samsung, ClearOne, Vaddio, Epiphan, Stoltzen, TiGHT AV, Interactive Online, Helvar, BrightSign, Logitech, and the list goes on...

Most of which involve one of these things:

- programming devices
  - 3rd party device control
- configuring devices
  - creating dsp designs for audio installations
- researching devices
  - product and system knowledge
  - ties in with the aforementioned
